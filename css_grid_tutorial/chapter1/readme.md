## Intro to the CSS Grid

CSS grid is growing/grown in website popularity. 

It can be sufficiently adapted to start adoving use of frameworks such as Bootstrap, a highly respected framework for HTML/CSS/JS.

i.e. 
* CSS grid mark-up moves away from excessive classes and rows.
* CSS grid only uses classes instead
* Separation in CSS is more flexible for media queries
  * Menu Item is "trapped" in the row items
  * must adjust the mark-up in places
  * need JavaScript--> more complexity

This can mean more separation and better readiability/integraiton with templates/generators.
