## CSS Grid vs. FlexBox


### CSS Grid
CSS Grid is *layout-first* and content is constrainted by the row/column placement. 
While it is abstract, content will follow placement along with justifications within the grid. 
For dynamic content, the "L" structure is useful to remember. 

Useful for:
* general layouts
* quick prototyping


### CSS FlexBox
CSS FlexBox is for single-row content, and lets the *content* drive the rendering, partially
allowing the content itself to decide how to redner.

Useful for:
* single-row content
* use with-in CSS Grid for a particular row where the content suits itself best
