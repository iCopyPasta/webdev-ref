# Getting Started

## What is React and why would we use it? 

Building user interfaces in that web pages are broken up and designed to avoid the long server/request where possible.

Mimics mobile in this respect.

## Why React Instead of "Just JavaScript" ?

### JavaScript
The Native appproach lets one build the minimal amount of JavaScript required.
However, this example shows that this is a copy/paste nightmare without more intelligent usage.

New issues with multiple elements:
* Query selector does not work
  * would need multiple IDs or some other schema to uniquely identify
  * would need to make sure for different views, different overlays and correct "todo" is deleted.
* must write every single step on its own - imperative approach
  * prone to repeative work

### React
Declarative, component-focused approach, "end goal". 

Lets the user define higher-level HTML in the JavaScript code.
Defines the end-result up-front with placeholders and flexible elements with programmatic rendering.

The React Engine/Library handles the actual 'low-level' instructions for us.


### Building Single-Page-Applications (SPAs)
We often build these type of webpages.

## React.js Alternatives

* React: Lean and focused **component-based** UI library; doesn't have many other built-in features.
  * Certain features (e.g. routing) are added via community packages.

* Angular
  * Complete component-based UI framework with features
  * Uses TypeScript
  * Can be overkill for smaller projects
  * Does not rely on community as much

* Vue.js
  * Complete component-based UI framework, includes most core features.
  * A bit less popular React & Angular
