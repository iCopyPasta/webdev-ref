# React Basics & Working with Components

ReactJS is all about "Components" - all user interfaces in the end are made up of components

Reusable building blocks in user interface.
*def:* A combination of HTML Code, SCSS/CSS, and JavaScript for logic if required.  

HTML and JavaScript are more important, CSS makes looks it pretty *after the fact*.  

A component is re-usable, but not required to be used multiple times.  
* Don't repeat yourself

Allows for a *separation of concerns*  
* Smaller codebase - not doing too many things in the same function

React uses a "Declarative Approach"
* You will not tell ReactJS 'How to place specifically here'
* Define the desired *end state(s)* and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions
* "Build your own, Customer HTML Elements*


# JSX

* HTML inside JavaScript
  * JSX = **J**ava**S**cript**X**ML
  * Written by React Team and is taken as input to node/npm engine
  * Developer friendly syntax
